\section{Conclustions}

This community finding is a unsupervised problem.
Hence, there are different methodology for answer the question


SOmething to try

- \lstinline|adjusted_rand_score|

\section{Future works}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Extend to other platforms
	\item Transform the problem into a classical clustering problem where cluster is a Tag/Sector
	      and apply classical dynamic clustering tools.
	      Note that this part is currently in trying phase.
	      If we have time to make it now, we could move it to the section 4.

  abstract = {This paper provides a description of the crowdfunding sector, considering investmentbased crowdfunding platforms as well as platforms in which funders do not obtain monetary payments. It lays out key features of this quickly developing sector and explores the economic forces at play that can explain the design of these platforms. In particular, it elaborates on cross-group and within-group external effects and asymmetric information on crowdfunding platforms.},

  abstract = {The modern science of networks has brought significant advances to our understanding of complex systems. One of the most relevant features of graphs representing real systems is community structure, or clustering, i.e. the organization of vertices in clusters, with many edges joining vertices of the same cluster and comparatively few edges joining vertices of different clusters. Such clusters, or communities, can be considered as fairly independent compartments of a graph, playing a similar role like, e.g., the tissues or the organs in the human body. Detecting communities is of great importance in sociology, biology and computer science, disciplines where systems are often represented as graphs. This problem is very hard and not yet satisfactorily solved, despite the huge effort of a large interdisciplinary community of scientists working on it over the past few years. We will attempt a thorough exposition of the topic, from the definition of the main elements of the problem, to the presentation of most methods developed, with a special focus on techniques designed by statistical physicists, from the discussion of crucial issues like the significance of clustering and how methods should be tested and compared against each other, to the description of applications to real networks.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the ability of entrepreneurs to influence the course of their crowdfunding campaigns. We study the interaction among crowdfunders and observe the existence of thresholds on the collected funds at some pivotal moments below which crowdfunders may massively abandon a project and identify hopeless, doubtful, and safe regions. This observation motivates a higher-level Stackelberg game, where the entrepreneur intervenes to influence the behavior of crowdfunders and move his campaign from his current region to a more favorable one. Our results show that the entrepreneur can play a crucial role even with a limited intervention.},

  abstract = {Crowdfunding allows founders of for-profit, artistic, and cultural ventures to fund their efforts by drawing on relatively small contributions from a relatively large number of individuals using the internet, without standard financial intermediaries. Drawing on a dataset of over 48,500 projects with combined funding over \$237 M, this paper offers a description of the underlying dynamics of success and failure among crowdfunded ventures. It suggests that personal networks and underlying project quality are associated with the success of crowdfunding efforts, and that geography is related to both the type of projects proposed and successful fundraising. Finally, I find that the vast majority of founders seem to fulfill their obligations to funders, but that over 75\% deliver products later than expected, with the degree of delay predicted by the level and amount of funding a project receives. These results offer insight into the emerging phenomenon of crowdfunding, and also shed light more generally on the ways that the actions of founders may affect their ability to receive entrepreneurial financing.},

  abstract = {Methods to efficiently uncover and extract community structures are required in a vast number of applications where networked data and their interactions can be modeled as graphs, and observing tightly-knit groups of vertices (“communities”) can offer insights into the structural and functional building blocks of the underlying network. Classical applications of community detection have largely focused on uni- partite networks—i.e., graphs built out of a single type of objects. However, due to increased availability of data from various sources, there is now an increasing need for handling heterogeneous networks which are built out of multiple types of objects. In this dissertation, we address the problem of identifying communities from bipar- tite networks—i.e., networks where interactions are observed between two different types of objects, with special interest in meaningful biological and ecological networks (e.g., genes and diseases, drugs and protein complexes, plants and pollinators, hosts and pathogens). Toward detecting communities in such bipartite networks, we make the following contributions: i) (metrics) we propose a variant of bipartite modularity called Murata+ and we extend this variant to manage not just inter-type, but also intra-type edge information of the network; ii) (algorithms) we present an efficient al- gorithm called biLouvain that implements a set of heuristics toward fast and precise community detection in large bipartite networks; and iii) (experiments) we present a thorough experimental evaluation of our algorithm including comparison to other state-of-the-art methods to identify communities in bipartite networks. Experimen- tal results show that our biLouvain algorithm identifies robust community structures that have a comparable or better quality (as measured by bipartite modularity) than existing methods, while significantly reducing the time-to-solution between one and four orders of magnitude. The implementation of our algorithm and heuristics is publicly available as open source at https://github.com/paolapesantez/biLouvain.},

To do so, we model the dynamics of crowdfunding from the funder’s and the receiver’s points of view, by a dynamic programming approach for computing the value of a platform’s opportunity at a given time and deriving the optimal funding decision. Our results highlight the importance of project duration on a crowdfunder’s investment choice, yielding interesting observations such as the existence of a key interval where the remaining campaign duration can be set up for successful funding and a corresponding dependence on the link between project target and utility.},

After discussing what sustains this pattern, we maintain that the internal social capital that proponents may develop inside the crowdfunding community provides crucial assistance in igniting a self–reinforcing mechanism. Results of an econometric analysis of a sample of 669 Kickstarter projects are consistent with this view. Moreover, the effect of internal social capital on the success of a campaign is fully mediated by the capital and backers collected in the campaign's early days.},

  abstract = {The modern science of networks has brought significant advances to our understanding of complex systems. One of the most relevant features of graphs representing real systems is community structure, or clustering, i.e. the organization of vertices in clusters, with many edges joining vertices of the same cluster and comparatively few edges joining vertices of different clusters. Such clusters, or communities, can be considered as fairly independent compartments of a graph, playing a similar role like, e.g., the tissues or the organs in the human body. Detecting communities is of great importance in sociology, biology and computer science, disciplines where systems are often represented as graphs. This problem is very hard and not yet satisfactorily solved, despite the huge effort of a large interdisciplinary community of scientists working on it over the past few years. We will attempt a thorough exposition of the topic, from the definition of the main elements of the problem, to the presentation of most methods developed, with a special focus on techniques designed by statistical physicists, from the discussion of crucial issues like the significance of clustering and how methods should be tested and compared against each other, to the description of applications to real networks.},

  abstract = {Crowdfunding provides an alternative way of financing, but its success is heavily challenged by information asymmetry. Based on the signal theory, this paper investigates the impact of hard information and soft information as project quality signals on crowdfunding performance. To this end, we extract soft information in two ways, including the topics from project descriptions by the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model and the investor sentiments from project comments by the sentiment analysis. Based on a dataset of 957 projects from the Dreamore, a major crowdfunding platform in China, the empirical results show that the impacts of experience of a creator, comment quantity, and the number of backers on crowdfunding performance are significantly positive, whereas reward execution moderates the impact of goal. In addition to the hard information, we find that the soft information also contributes greatly to crowdfunding performance. Specifically, the topics of project descriptions play an important role in crowdfunding performance. The positive sentiment in project comments has a positive impact on crowdfunding performance, whereas the negative one has a negative impact. These empirical findings are significant for crowdfunding platforms, creators, and investors from both theoretical and practical perspectives.},

Despite this, and despite the fact that many ad-hoc tools have been designed for the study of special cases, very few exist to analyse (describe, extract relevant information) such networks in a systematic way. We propose here an extension of the most basic notions used nowadays to analyse classical complex networks to the bipartite case. To achieve this, we introduce a set of simple statistics, which we discuss by comparing their values on a representative set of real-world networks and on their random versions.},

Drawing on a dataset of over 48,500 projects with combined funding over \$237 M, this paper offers a description of the underlying dynamics of success and failure among crowdfunded ventures. It suggests that personal networks and underlying project quality are associated with the success of crowdfunding efforts, and that geography is related to both the type of projects proposed and successful fundraising. Finally, I find that the vast majority of founders seem to fulfill their obligations to funders, but that over 75\% deliver products later than expected, with the degree of delay predicted by the level and amount of funding a project receives. These results offer insight into the emerging phenomenon of crowdfunding, and also shed light more generally on the ways that the actions of founders may affect their ability to receive entrepreneurial financing.},

  abstract = {Methods to efficiently uncover and extract community structures are required in a vast number of applications where networked data and their interactions can be modeled as graphs, and observing tightly-knit groups of vertices (“communities”) can offer insights into the structural and functional building blocks of the underlying network. Classical applications of community detection have largely focused on uni- partite networks—i.e., graphs built out of a single type of objects. However, due to increased availability of data from various sources, there is now an increasing need for handling heterogeneous networks which are built out of multiple types of objects. In this dissertation, we address the problem of identifying communities from bipar- tite networks—i.e., networks where interactions are observed between two different types of objects, with special interest in meaningful biological and ecological networks (e.g., genes and diseases, drugs and protein complexes, plants and pollinators, hosts and pathogens). Toward detecting communities in such bipartite networks, we make the following contributions: i) (metrics) we propose a variant of bipartite modularity called Murata+ and we extend this variant to manage not just inter-type, but also intra-type edge information of the network; ii) (algorithms) we present an efficient al- gorithm called biLouvain that implements a set of heuristics toward fast and precise community detection in large bipartite networks; and iii) (experiments) we present a thorough experimental evaluation of our algorithm including comparison to other state-of-the-art methods to identify communities in bipartite networks. Experimen- tal results show that our biLouvain algorithm identifies robust community structures that have a comparable or better quality (as measured by bipartite modularity) than existing methods, while significantly reducing the time-to-solution between one and four orders of magnitude. The implementation of our algorithm and heuristics is publicly available as open source at https://github.com/paolapesantez/biLouvain.},

  abstract = {In recent years, as a novel financing mechanism, crowdfunding has gained popularity worldwide. In China, Crowdfunding started in 2011 and has experienced extremely fast growth since then. Several studies have identified success factors for crowdfunding. While these studies help infer the dynamics of crowdfunding, such dynamics have not been sufficiently examined, particularly by large-scale empirical studies. In addition, the relationship between crowdfunding market characteristics and project funding success remains fuzzy. In this research, we first empirically assessed the effect of crowdfunding success factors using a large sample (N = 5128) collected from Taobao.com, a leading crowdfunding platform in China. Built upon these factors, we conducted a multi-period, multi-party simulation study that evaluate crowdfund raisers’ project positioning decisions and investors’ project funding decision in a massive market. In the simulation study, we varied market characteristics such as the number of projects, number of investors per project, entrepreneurs’ moral risk, and ratio of community over financial benefits, to observe their effect on participants’ decisions and consequently, project funding success rate. Results reveal that dynamics of a crowdfunding market are rather complex. These insights contribute to a more in-depth theoretical understanding of crowdfunding, as well as provide useful guidance for crowdfund raisers, investors, and administrators.},

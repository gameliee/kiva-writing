\begin{itemize}
	\item The dynamic of crowdfunding is rather complex and not well-understood
	\item We would like to understand the role of community in crowdfunding
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item Hypothesis: there might be communities (explicit or implicit) of lenders (contributors) who willing to contribute to same type of projects again and again
		            \begin{itemize}
			            \item Describle the hypothesis in more details. What is type of projects?
		            \end{itemize}
	      \end{itemize}
	\item The objective of the thesis is to Detect Community Dynamic. If it exists on platforms?
	\item We will test the hypothesis on kiva.org dataset
	\item \textit{Briefly} describe the kiva platform
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item What is kiva.org and how it works?
		      \item Overview of the data schema: Lender, Project, Sector, Tags, and how those can be viewd as a graph
		      \item What is type of projects in this dataset?
		            \begin{itemize}
			            \item Type means \textit{type of impact} or \textit{localization}
			                  \begin{itemize}
				                  \item Type of impact: impact more on sociality, impact more on environements,... Represented by Sector or Tags
				                  \item Localization: represent by country where borrower live in
			                  \end{itemize}
		            \end{itemize}
	      \end{itemize}
	\item \textit{Briefly} describe how we will work:
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item Given the graph-like database, we will find community of lenders in the database using \textit{community finding on graphs} techniques
		      \item This is a unsupervised problem
	      \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

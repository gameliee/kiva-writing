\begin{itemize}
	\item The creatioon of Lender-Criteria bipartite graphs
	\item Explain why we could not project Lender-Criteria graphs onto Lender to create Lender-Lender graph
	\item That's why we find communify directly in bipartite graphs
	\item Methodology: better-than-random testing
\end{itemize}

\section{Hypothesis testing on syntehsis data}

\begin{itemize}
	\item How to build a random graph, with community pre-defined
	\item Detecting community in random graph
	\item Quality assessment of the detected community, presented by a numer $Q_{synthesis}$
	\item $Q_{synthesis}$ gives an idea about the best we could get from a data, but depends on the laten parameters when building datasets $p_{in}$, $p_{out}$, $p_{change}$ - the change from community to another
\end{itemize}

\section{Hypothesis testing on real data}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Filter data to keep Lenderes who is active invest from 2019-2023
	\item Rpeat the works on random graph for each year data
	\item Then find quality assessment $Q_{real}$ again and compare with $Q_{synthesis}$.
	      Decide if there is a clear community for different criteria (Tags, Sectors, Country)
\end{itemize}
